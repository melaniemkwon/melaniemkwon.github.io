## Fun with functional programming: Javascript, Python

Even though languages like Javascript and Python aren't inherently functional,
the *paradigm* behind functional programming can be applied across many contexts. To quote Robert C. Martin--

>Paradigms are a way of programming, relatively unrelated to languages. A paradigm tells you which programming structures to use, and when to use them.

Found this cute jewel about functional programming in Javascript, which might resonate with React developers - [A Mostly Adequate Guide to Functional Programming](https://drboolean.gitbooks.io/mostly-adequate-guide-old/content/). It's written in a very conversational style with fun examples.

So far, I haven't found an accessible Python equivalent about FP paradigm except for maybe Steven F. Lott's book [Functional Python Programming](https://www.amazon.com/Functional-Python-Programming-programming-built-ebook/dp/B0788WZRKZ/ref=dp_ob_title_def) but it's not nearly as entertaining and can get dense (I havent finished it yet).
